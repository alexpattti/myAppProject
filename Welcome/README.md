## About This Project

I know you're supposed to do these in a specific way. I've never made one, and I don't know how.

Essentially, I'm doing this to test myself, and because my family and I have this business idea that we want to put into work. Yes I could pay someone to do this, put I don't want to. So I'm building this from scratch. 


The project will be organized and things will be clearly labeled. 

There will be a roadmap labeled roadMap.md (yes camel case, it's fun)

I use TickTick for my daily reminders and tasks and I also set up what's in the roadMap.md, but as tasks/subtasks for TickTick. So I'll be updating both when needed.
