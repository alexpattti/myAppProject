Notes:

You'll see in the roadmap that there are a lot of buffer days. Ideally I'd like to not use all of them, but this is my first project, and I'm new to the entire coding world. But I gave myself a cushion so that way I just move on a day ahead. Doing that will also help me stay motivated, as it will trick my brain into thinking I'm ahead of schedule which will keep me the momentum high.
